          The war in Ukraine has affected each Ukrainian and a lot of people
          around the globe. At the moment the war is being actively waged and is
          in the hot phase, but when Ukraine wins, a new stage will begin - the
          stage of restoration of our country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ukrainian zoos are in severe need of help now and will be in need
          after the war ends. There are no visitors in the zoos, which results
          in no budgeting.
